    "description": "Have friends and family? Tired of them playing without you? Get Companionship! This mod makes playing on your map/server pain if you do it alone! When just a single player is on the map/server, the game slows down to painfully slow speed until more people join. Once a second player joins the map/server, the game returns to normal speed! \nThis is softmod compatible."
